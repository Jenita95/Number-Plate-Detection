# 🚗🔍 Number Plate Detection & 🎤 Emotion Analysis Prototype
# 📌 Overview
This project combines Computer Vision and AI to:

🚘 Detect and read number plates from vehicle images using EasyOCR

🧠 Prototype an audio-based Emotion Detection system using Whisper AI + SVM

# 🚘 Part 1: Number Plate Detection
# 🎯 Objective
📸 Load a vehicle image

🧾 Detect and extract the number plate

🔤 Read text using OCR

🖼️ Show result with bounding boxes

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
🧱 OpenCV

👁️ EasyOCR

📊 Matplotlib

☁️ Google Colab + Google Drive

# ✅ Features
🧠 Smart OCR-based plate reading

🔄 Multi-format support

🎥 Extendable to live video

🖍️ Text and bounding box visualization

# ⚠️ Limitations
🚫 No real-time processing

🌫️ Struggles with poor lighting or angles

🔠 Limited font/language support

# 🧠 Part 2: Emotion Detection from Audio (Prototype)
# 🎯 Objective
🗣️ Transcribe speech with Whisper AI

🎶 Extract MFCC + pitch features

📈 Classify emotions using SVM

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
🗣️ openai-whisper

🎧 librosa

🤖 scikit-learn

🎞️ moviepy

# 📁 Dataset
🎛️ Simulated audio features (MFCC + pitch)

😃 Emotion classes: happy, sad, angry, neutral

# ⚠️ Limitations
🤖 Fake dataset (not real speech)

🧠 No semantic understanding

❌ Offline only (no live input)

# 🚀 How to Run
# 🛠️ Setup
pip install openai-whisper librosa scikit-learn moviepy easyocr opencv-python
# 📂 Mount Google Drive (Colab)
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
# ▶️ Run Detection
📁 Place vehicle images in /content/drive/MyDrive/Indian_Number_Plates/Sample_Images

🧪 Run the script to process and detect plates

# 🔮 Future Enhancements
🎥 Real-time plate detection in video

🎙️ Use real emotional speech datasets

🌐 Deploy emotion model as web/mobile app

🧬 Multimodal input: voice + face + text

🧠 Advanced semantic and prosody analysis

# 📘 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a functional pipeline for detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates using OCR, and a prototype for detecting human emotion from speech using AI. While the number plate system is reasonably accurate and extendable, the emotion detection component is an early-stage mockup relying on synthetic data. With real datasets, real-time processing, and multimodal inputs, both systems can evolve into powerful tools for intelligent traffic systems and emotion-aware applications.
